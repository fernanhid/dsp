[Think Stats Chapter 3 Exercise 1](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2004.html#toc31) (actual vs. biased)

<pre>
<b> Code </b>
from collections import defaultdict

import chap01soln
resp = chap01soln.ReadFemResp()

unbiased_dist = defaultdict(int)
for value in resp.numkdhh:
    unbiased_dist[value]+=1
    
unbiased_dist = dict(unbiased_dist)

def to_bias(unbiased_dist):
    bias = unbiased_dist.copy()
    
    for number, frequency in bias.items():
        bias[number] = bias[number] * number
    return bias
    
bias_dist = to_bias(unbiased_dist)

<b>Distribution Results</b>
unbiased_pmf
{0: 3563, 1: 1636, 2: 1500, 3: 666, 4: 196, 5: 82}

bias_dist:
{0: 0, 1: 1636, 2: 3000, 3: 1998, 4: 784, 5: 410}

<b>Mean</b>
<i>mean of biased_distributions</i>
sum(to_bias(bias_dist).values())/float(sum(bias_dist.values()))
2.4036791006642821

<i>mean of unbiased distributions</i>
sum(to_bias(unbiased_dist).values())/float(sum(unbiased_dist.values()))
1.0242051550438309


<b>Graph </b>



<b>Intuition </b>
The unbiased distribution of the number of children under 18 in a household has a lower 
mean than the biased one since the households with zero children and ignored in the biased
distributions. You can clearly see this in the graph, where household with no children make 
up most households in the unbiased distributions but none in the biased ones.
